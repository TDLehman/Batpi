Expected parts of this project (roughly in order): 
1. [X] Set up a sonic distance sensor. That is, get the pi to successfully interpret input from the sensor. 
2. [] Give physical feedback based on proximity (led, vibration motor, etc). 
3. [] receive multiple samples, via either Mounting additional Sensors, or mounting sensor to motor. 
4. [] The pi interprets SDS input, and can display it as an image. 
5. [] Make python scripts run at startup. 
6. [X] set up SSH access to PI, regardless of which network it is connected to. (Working via weaved)
7. [X] Safely power PI with a battery. 
7.5[] Auto-shutdown function, 5v regulator, power switch, etc. 
8. [] connect project to a chassis, wheeled motors, motor controller, additional psu to allow mobility. (can be broken into smaller parts) 
9. [] Write navigation program using distance samples to prevent collisions. (perhaps goal oriented, crossing a room)

Experience gained in this project:
  GIT as a Version Control System Additional
